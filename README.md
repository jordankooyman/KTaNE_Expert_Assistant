# KTaNE_Expert_Assistant
A program for solving all the puzzles in the base version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, a cooperative timed puzzle game, to reduce the number of players needed in the role of expert down to just 1, with multiple versions.
This program replaces the bomb defusal manual that would normally be needed, and solves all the puzzles for you (however, having 2 players is still recommended, as switching between 2 devices if playing solo makes gameplay much slower, and more than 2 players does not leave enough for additional players to do as there are no puzzles to solve).

There are currently 2 complete versions:
	Terminal Version (C++)
	Windows GUI Version (C++/CLI)
	
There are plans to port this program to other languages or consoles.

The terminal version was done in collaboration with Bradley Walby, with each function in the code having an author indicated. Many of the same functions are modified and used in the windows GUI version, and original author credit is still given.

Both versions were written in Visual Studio, but only the Windows GUI version requires Visual Studio, the terminal version can run from any C++ IDE with few (if any) changes, as it only uses a few very basic libraries.

This is being retroactively uploaded to GitHub since this was done about a year prior and I did not attempt to use GitHub at the time due to lack of experience when working with multiple developers.

Additionally, for the windows GUI version, the code is very disorganized and messy, and not very well written. However, this was my first experience with C++/CLI and it was completed 5 days after starting.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is made by Steel Crate Games, who have no affiliation with this project. All code in this project is the work of Jordan Kooyman and Bradley Walby, unless otherwise noted, and only images of the modules from the game were used to increase familiarity in the Windows GUI Version.
